Hello,

I'm trying this:

class Poller
  def self.call(env)
    if env["PATH_INFO"] =~ /^\\/poller/
      @posts = Post.find(1, :select => "title")
      [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/html"}, @posts.title]
    else
      [404, {"Content-Type" => "text/html"}, ["Not Found"]]

@Michael: You're welcome.

@Diego:

Can you provide any numbers on that so we get an idea how much it sucks? So you compared this to a non-Metal controller doing about the same thing and that was faster (Metal version is slower)?

Also, make sure you are in production mode when testing for performance. If you're already in production mode, I can only guess that the DB call is slow. Performance of queries to DB can change, so you might want to get more samples for your benchmark, or mock the Post and stub the find method so that line won't touch the DB (only for your perf test of course)."""

If you're fetching Active Records and rendering templates and partials, you've probably ventured outside the area where metal is going to give you a worthwhile boost. Have you benchmarked this vs a simple Action Controller? I doubt you're going to see a big difference.

I'd reserve Metal use to something even simpler. Like outputting prerendered text from a memcached server after doing a simple check for permissions (not going through Active Record)."""
