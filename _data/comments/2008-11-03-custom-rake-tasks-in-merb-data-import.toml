Thanks, these is very useful for me.
BTW, should this work in slices too? Can't see my custom tasks."""

@Uri: You might want to check out these pages in the merbivore wiki:

http://wiki.merbivore.com/howto/slice

There's a part there in 'Create table from model' section where he noted that the slice didn't have access to rake db:automigrate, and so he piped the 'Datamapper.automigrate!' command to the slice.

http://wiki.merbivore.com/howto/slice/rake_tasks

In this page, it's shown that you need to add the dependencies in the Rakefile of your slice."""

Can you tell me what your script expect as yaml syntax?
I get the following error:
rake aborted!
undefined method `keys` for ["reason1", {"name"=>"My own reason"}]:Array

With this yaml:
reason1:

Hi Philippe,

I suggest you try dumping some data so you can see the yaml expected. Here's an example data dump on my side:


---
- :word: burger

- :word: food

Hrmmm.. the load task doesn't work. It croaks on the created_at and updated_at columns. \"Invalid time\"

Seems like YAML is a very odd choice for this. Why not just use sql in and sql out? The data format conversions make things very unstable."""

I have created_at and updated_at in several places in the project that I used this. I didn't have any problems. Can you give more details about your environment? The Merb version and DM version you're using, what your database is, and maybe how your updated_at/created_at data looks like in your YAML file?

I like YAML because it has a nice format, and it's quite easy to modify the data before loading it. I guess if I had your errors and couldn't make YAML work, then I'd consider other solutions. Btw, it's not exactly my solution. As mentioned above, I just translated Tobi's work which I think is amazing coz it was an old article, and yet it just worked for my case.

Anyway, I hope you could give me the details of your environment so I can take a look at the problem."""

I was having issues with join tables which have names such as "roles_users" because of the double pluralization.

To resolve this I changed:

INSERT INTO #{table.name.pluralize.snake_case}

to:

INSERT INTO #{table.storage_name}

This uses the proper table name instead."""
