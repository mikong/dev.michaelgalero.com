[Slicehost](http://slicehost.com "Slicehost"), for the great VPS hosting. If you are currently in their waiting list, I suggest you get the 24-month prepayment. I got my slice in about a week. I think it's better to pay for the long term than go to other hosting and pay about 3x more.

Wordpress, for the blogging platform. I planned on using [Mephisto](http://mephistoblog.com/ "Mephisto") but... maybe in another post.

And [Scribbish](http://quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish "Scribbish"), for the theme. I wasn't able to access Kenny Pitt's blog for the Wordpress version (I only get a blank page), but thanks to Google's cache, I got the download link:
[http://pittcrew.net/projects/scribbishwp/scribbishwp-1.0-3.0.tar.gz](http://pittcrew.net/projects/scribbishwp/scribbishwp-1.0-3.0.tar.gz)
