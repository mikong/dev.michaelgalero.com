As a web developer, it was a year full of changes. My OS for work before was Windows 2000, now it's Mac OS X. I used Java and a proprietary web framework and now I mainly program with [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) and [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/). I used a proprietary javascript framework, and now [Prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/). I primarily used Eclipse as my IDE, now I use [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) (I used emacs for about a month). My database was Oracle, now it's [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/) or [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/). From CVS to [SVN](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/), and recently using [Git](http://git.or.cz/) on personal projects. That's changes to my OS, programming language, web framework, IDE, database and version control system. And here's more...

From the waterfall software development model to agile software development. And from working with large teams (of 20 to 50 or more) for more than a year on each project to a small team (of 1 to 4) working on 2 week iterations (see [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development))). And as described in this [older article](http://devblog.michaelgalero.com/2007/11/27/a-journey-with-dvorak-so-far/), I switched my keyboard layout from QWERTY to [Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) a few months back.

I didn't test a year ago. Instead, I passed my code to software testers. I've heard of JUnit but never used it. Now, I'm learning [BDD](http://behaviour-driven.org/) with [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).

There are also other changes like starting this development blog, participating in the [Philippine Ruby Users Group](http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-phil), and [contributing to Rails](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/). Using newer releases like Ruby 1.9 (only for playing around though) and Rails 2.0 for my new projects. From Ubuntu Dapper to Gutsy (I skipped Edgy Eft and Feisty Fawn). Et cetera.

2007 was fun! And I'm curious how this article will look like a year from now. :)
