This is a test post following an old [TextMate screencast](http://macromates.com/screencast/blogging_take_two.mov) demonstrating the blogging bundle.<!--more-->To make this post a little bit useful, I used (as a test) the selection grab of the RubyConf 2007 page from the [Confreaks](http://rubyconf2007.confreaks.com/) site. Follow the link to download videos of the presentations in awesome h.264 format.[![Confreaks Rubyconf 2007](http://devblog.michaelgalero.com/files/2007/12/confreaks-rubyconf-2007.jpg)](http://rubyconf2007.confreaks.com/)**Update:** As the screencast used the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax, I tried installing the [PHP Markdown plugin](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/) for Wordpress. After activating it, most of my previous entries looked OK, but there were a few problems. A couple of paragraphs were merged as one. The underscore characters I've used to discuss code were treated as markdown syntax for emphasis. And I'm concerned how it will affect my RSS feed. I do expect that the HTML generated from Markdown will be the version my few subscribers will receive. But will all the entries be regenerated in my feed, and so will my subscribers receive updates on all my entries? Back to HTML syntax for me. I have tried the Markdown syntax before in [Jottit](http://jottit.com/), an excellent wiki, and I've enjoyed the syntax but not so much as to have to deal with updating my old entries, few they may be.
