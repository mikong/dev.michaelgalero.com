Last Wednesday, I attended the 2nd Rails Coding Session of the Philippine Ruby Users Group (PHRUG). The small, informal gathering was planned for writing Rails apps with plugins like acts_as_solr, memcached, etc. None of us wrote a single line of code. Instead, we discussed several Rails and Ruby topics and gathered ideas for future Rails events.Some of the topics discussed were:- [RESTful Rails](http://topfunky.com/clients/peepcode/REST-cheatsheet.pdf "REST cheatsheet pdf from Peepcode")
- [DataMapper](http://datamapper.org/ "DataMapper's official, nice-looking website")
- Rails and Legacy Databases
- [BDD and RSpec](http://railsenvy.com/2007/10/4/how-i-learned-to-love-testing-presentation "a Rails Envy presentation on BDD and RSpec")
- [Sinatra](http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/ "Sinatra's concise website")
- favorite [gems](http://www.workingwithrails.com/browse/rubygems/usage "Working with Rails page on Gems popularity") and [plugins](http://www.workingwithrails.com/browse/railsplugins/usage "Working with Rails page on Plugins popularity")
- Rails hosting experiences, particularly with [Slicehost](http://www.slicehost.com/ "Slicehost official website") and [Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com/ "Engine Yard official website")
- teaching Rails to college students
The future Rails events planned are coding sessions (hopefully with actual coding involved), monthly meetups (with the next meetup probably in January and to be held at either the [Ateneo de Manila University campus](http://www.admu.edu.ph/ "Ateneo de Manila website, see footer for address") or [Stratpoint Technologies office](http://www.stratpoint.com/contact.html "Contact page of Stratpoint technologies with address")), and possibly a Philippine Rails Conference. Some notable issues covered were the challenges of organizing a large conference (including problems involved with having closed source companies as sponsors), andÂ  problems with matching the level of explanation in your presentations with the knowledge of your audience.The Rails community in the Philippines is only starting to grow. But I'm glad that the local Rails events are increasing in both frequency and number of participants. Previous Rails events I've attended are the First PHRUG Meetup last January, Rails Happy Hour last September, Rails Talk with the presentation by Guy Naor last October, and most recently this "coding session" (I missed the 1st Rails Coding Session 2 weeks ago).Before I end this post, I'd like to thank Rad and the [Development Executive Group](http://www.developmentex.com/index.jsp "Development Executive Group's official website") for accommodating us for the session.
