I sometimes wanted to write an article about [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_board_game) (board game) in this development blog, but I could never justify it. But now that a couple of Ruby/Rails blogs posted articles [this year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008) relating programming to Go, I finally have an excuse. :)

The first article is from the O'Reilly Ruby blog entitled ["Ruby Conferences vs. Go Tournaments"](http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2008/01/ruby_conferences_vs_go_tournam.html). The other one is from the Rails Spikes blog, ["Why programmers should play Go"](http://railspikes.com/2008/7/14/why-programmers-should-play-go), which Fabio Akita even [translated to Portuguese](http://www.akitaonrails.com/2008/7/15/off-topic-por-que-programadores-devem-jogar-go) (with additional notes) in his Akita on Rails blog. Check them out!

I was pleasantly surprised to find that these developers also have passions for both Go and programming and even went so far as comparing them. Previously, the only way I could think of linking the two was to create a Go program using Ruby. But now that I think about it, it seems like they're connected on a deeper level.

Go and programming are my passions that take up most of my time. It has been a real struggle to balance the two. Every time I program too much, I would start to miss Go and do my best to find time for it. At times it's the other way around. And then I just realized, I started to learn both Ruby and Go at about the same time (end of December 2006). I even joined the [Philippine Ruby Users Group (PhRUG)](http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-phil) and started the [Philippine Go Association mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/philippine-go-association) at about those times too. A coincidence? I THINK NOT!

If you don't know Go, I encourage you to [read about it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_board_game). If you're a fellow PhRUG member who knows Go and wants to play a game with me, or wants to learn it, you can send me an email through the group. Or just join [our Go mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/philippine-go-association).
